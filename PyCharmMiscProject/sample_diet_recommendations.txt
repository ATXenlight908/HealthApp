DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MICHAEL RODRIGUEZ

Based on your food log for June 12, 2025, and your health profile, I've analyzed your current intake and have the following recommendations:

ALLERGY ASSESSMENT:
✓ No shellfish detected in today's meals (good avoidance of severe allergen)
✓ No sulfa-containing foods identified in current intake

MEAL TIMING AND MEDICATION CONSIDERATIONS:
! MORNING MEDICATION ALIGNMENT: Your breakfast at 7:30 AM is well-timed for taking Sertraline with food as prescribed. Continue this pattern.
! EVENING PLANNING NEEDED: Ensure you have a light evening meal at least 2 hours before taking Atorvastatin at bedtime.

CHRONIC CONDITION SUPPORT:
For Hyperlipidemia Management:
- Your breakfast choice of oatmeal is excellent for cholesterol management (contains soluble fiber)
- Consider adding ground flaxseed (1 tbsp) to your morning oatmeal for additional omega-3 fatty acids
- The mayo in your sandwich could be replaced with avocado or hummus for healthier fats
- Add more fiber-rich vegetables to your lunch sandwich

For Anxiety Management:
- Consider adding foods rich in magnesium and B vitamins for your afternoon snack
- Add green tea as an afternoon beverage (contains L-theanine which may help with anxiety)
- Limit caffeine after noon (your morning coffee is fine, but avoid additional caffeine later)

BLOOD SUGAR MANAGEMENT:
! Your morning blood sugar readings show elevation (6:00-7:00 AM)
- Add protein to breakfast (consider adding Greek yogurt or eggs alongside oatmeal)
- Your lunch has good protein-carb balance with the turkey sandwich
