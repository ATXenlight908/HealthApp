Based on the patient's health profile, current medications, vital signs, and health conditions, please generate a comprehensive 7-day diet plan in JSON format. The diet plan should:

1. Support management of the patient's chronic conditions (Hyperlipidemia and Generalized Anxiety Disorder)
2. Consider medication timing and requirements (Sertraline with breakfast, Atorvastatin at bedtime)
3. Address blood sugar management concerns, especially during morning hours
4. STRICTLY AVOID any allergens (particularly shellfish which is a SEVERE allergy for this patient)
5. Include appropriate calorie and macronutrient targets based on the patient's height, weight, and health status
6. Provide specific meal timing recommendations that align with medication schedule

IMPORTANT: For each food item in the diet plan, include an "allergyAlert" field set to:
- "SEVERE" if the food contains or may contain shellfish (patient has severe shellfish allergy)
- "MODERATE" if the food contains or may contain sulfa drugs (patient has moderate sulfa drug allergy)
- "NONE" if the food is safe regarding the patient's known allergies

Please structure the response as valid JSON with the following format:
- Include daily calorie and macronutrient targets
- Provide a 7-day meal plan with breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, and optional evening snack
- For each meal, include food items with portions and nutritional information (calories, protein, fat, carbs, sugar, fiber, salt)
- Include the allergyAlert field for each food item
- Include hydration recommendations
- Add specific notes related to medication timing and health conditions
